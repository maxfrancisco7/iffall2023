                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <li>10 egg yolks</li>
                    <li>14oz condensed milk</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk</li>
                    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol type="1">
                    <li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white.</li>
                    <li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater.</li>
                    <li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire.</li>
                    <li>Put in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into caramel with a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.</li>
                    <li>Spread the caramel evenly on the flat side of the mold.</li>
                    <li>Wait for 5 minutes, then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold.</li>
                    <li>Cover the top of the mold with aluminum foil.</li>
                    <li>Steam the mold with the egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After steaming, let cool then refrigerate.</li>
                    <li>Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
