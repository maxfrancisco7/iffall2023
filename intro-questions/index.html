        <b>Max's Introductory Questions</b><br>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Max Francisco. I'm a Junior majoring in Communication Design.</li>
            <li>My background is primarily in graphic design and video editing. I was prompted to take this class as a part of my major requirements, but I am interested to learn.</li>
            <li>I don't have any prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to get enough of a grasp of HTML and CSS so that I can add another dimension to my design work, and also so I can get a deeper understanding of interaction design.</li>
            <li>Compared to designing for paper, I expect designing for screens to require much deeper consideration of the end user and how they will interact with what I make.</li>
            <li><a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> In my opinion, Unsplash has a very effectively designed site. The search bar is placed front and center for users who know what they are looking for, but there are also categories and featured images placed lower in hierarchy for users who are simply browsing.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.obscurifymusic.com/home">Obscurify</a> A site with effective communication is Obscurify. It provides various interpretations of Spotify user data to let them learn about their listening habits. Each section of information is spaced well and displayed in a unique, yet effective way to provide seamless communication.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> I think the YouTube site works well for its purposes of displaying video content to the user, and once the user has found one, the site continues guiding the user towards more videos to keep them hooked.</li>
