                    It's been two years, I keep calling<br>
                    I'm standing here and I ain't got you<br>
                    As we lay here, lovers in arms<br>
                    I can feel your fear, can this love be true?<br>
                    Come on, lift me up, love, I keep falling<br>
                    I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling<br>
                    Lift me up, love, I keep falling<br>
                    I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling<br>
            </p>
            <h4><span class="section">Verse 1: Vince Staples</span></h4><br>
            <p>
                    She said, "Baby, keep me closely"<br>
                    Love it when you hold me<br>
                    Know that I'm a real one, I don't do no ghostin'<br>
                    I know that you love me, you don't gotta show me<br>
                    Off to the world, please, hide me from the police<br>
                    Everywhere you go, we together, inseparable<br>
                    You know I'm down for whatever, protective of you<br>
                    I don't wanna use protection with you<br>
                    But the glove'll keep you safe if you ever get loose<br>
                    Never put you in a jam, hold whatever for you<br>
                    When you first shot your shot, I knew you would the one to hit the spot<br>
                    Only you can make it clap for the homies I am not<br>
                    On the late nights, me and you, circling the block<br>
                    Tryna make it pop<br>
                    Put that pussy nigga 'cross the street from Cherry Park<br>
                    Hope we don't get caught<br>
                    Don't you break my heart<br>
                    Love how you illuminate my thoughts<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                    Damn, can't believe they took you from me<br>
                    Kickin' in your front door, lookin' for me<br>
                    Hit me in our secret place<br>
                    Nothing I could do for you but sit and wait<br>
                    Contemplate<br>
                    Did we leave a trail? Did we make mistakes?<br>
                    Can't drop on your bail, can't check on your case<br>
                    Know that you won't tell, that's why I'm afraid<br>
                    You'll probably never get to see the light of day<br>
                    I'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now<br>
                    We shoulda took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now<br>
                    At least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down<br>
                    Is you trippin'? You forgettin' now we made these vows?<br>
                    Still here I am, waiting 'round<br>
                    Dreaming that you comin' home, right your wrongs, take me out<br>
                    I can't wait until you bust it down<br>
                    Probably go a hunnid rounds<br>
